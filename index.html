				<h2>A Linux Workstation <strong>Made Simple?</strong></h2>

<p>GoldenDog Linux is an automated selection of packages and presets for a Debian Stable Operating System.
				   This is the selection of packages that I designed for personal use and now I decided to automatize and pack
				   as an installable iso file. </p>

				<h2>What about <strong>Updating</strong> my system?</h2>
				<p>Since GDL, at its core, uses Debian software, and Debian recommends to use their mirrors to ensure reliability and stability, GoldenDog uses <a href="https://debian.org">Debian</a> Stable
				   official repositores, maintaining a robust and reliable performance, and also, all updates and software libraries that are currently available for Debian Bookworm are available for GoldenDog</p>

				Studio Code, along with its official repository (Microsoft) so you can always keep it updated to its latest version.
				   Lots of applications run natively like <strong>Steam</strong>, kdenlive, obs, Spotify, and many more! Ideal for working, gaming, developing or checking the mail and chatting!</p>

				<blockquote><p class="editable">GDL was born as an automation tool for myself to deploy my own operating system consistently across my different machines. Some people heard about it and suggested I turned my tool into an installable public .iso for everyone who wants to have a similar setup, so here it is. It's been handcrafted with lots of love. Hope you like it!</p>
